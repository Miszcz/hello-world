# hello-world

Waddup fellas. It's Tanner from Highschool. Remember me? Me and the guys used to give you a hard time in school. Sorry you were just the easy target lol. I can see not much has changed. Remember Sarah the girl you had a crush on? Yeah we're married now. I make over 200k a year and drive a mustang GT. I guess some things never change huh losers? Nice catching up lol. Pathetic..
